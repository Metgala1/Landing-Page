# landing-page
Just learn about flexbox.

i have been give a sample of a landing-page.

My task is to try to create a similar copy of that landing page.

The styles of the landing page have been provided to me, and the sample of the page too.

check the sample folder, to see the sample and the styles of the page i will create.

Worked on the layout of my page.

I use i used display flex and flex-direction column for my page layout.

i have have five divs in the flex parent element and i have give each div background-colors from the sample given to me.

i used flexbox to position my nav-list and my logo. made my nav elemnet flex and used align-self to get logo and the nav-list centeralised

i inserted an image in the right div, this photo is from another website called shutterstock.

it has a width of 100% and height 100% within that div and i used the object-fit  property and a value contain to make it fit and look good within that div.

the image can be found in the new folder i've added called images.

i have 4 photos in my images all of them are from a website call allrecipes.com.

in my second secton i have heading and four images.
this images are in div different divs with same class.

those four divs are in a div which has a display of flex enabling them to be sideby side.

why they have the same class is because anyy style that is give will affact the 4 divs.

i used figcaption to write the names of teh various dishes
